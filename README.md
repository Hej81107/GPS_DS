A data structures project simulating cell tower acquisition strategies using different algorithms.  
Each cell tower has a value, a cost, and a radius.  
The value is an integer representing the population density in the area. Higher is better.  
The cost is the price to buy the tower, and will be subtracted from the budget when purchased.  
The radius is a circular zone around each tower. If there are other towers within the radius of a tower, they will be included in the purchase of one tower.
